## Creator

This dataset was created by the University of Basel's Research and Infrastructure Support RISE (rise@unibas.ch) in 2022. It is based on the digital collection "Basler Rheinschifffahrt-Aktiengesellschaft, insbesondere über die Veräusserung des Dieselmotorbootes 'Rheinfelden' und die Gewährung eines Darlehens zur Finanzierung der Erstellung des Dieselmotorbootes 'Rhyblitz' an diese Firma" (shelf mark: `CH SWA HS 191 V 10`, persistent link: http://dx.doi.org/10.7891/e-manuscripta-54917, referred to as "the collection" in what follows) of the Schweizer Wirtschaftsarchiv.

## Description of the collection

Todo.

## Data processing

The main task of data processing was to structure and transcribe the collection.

- Images were extracted from the collection by importing the collection into Transkribus (Expert Client v.1.17.0) and then exporting its 137 images as JPEGs `/files/images`. The sequence of the images by name (`0001.jpg` to `0137.jpg`) is the sequence of the images in the collection; note that image `0001.jpg` is a cover page (this metadata on the collection in Transkribus is provided by `transkribus_metadata.xml` and `transkribus_mets.xml`). 
- Images in the `/files/images` were then grouped into semantic items using Tropy (v1.11.1) following the inscribed item numbers provided by the collection: a red penciled number in the right upper corner of an image indicates a new item. There are 68 such items consisting of 1 to 8 images. All items are letters (with enclosures where appropriate) except for items number 30 and 44 (journal articles), item 54 (transcript of phone call), and item 56 (telegraph). Each non-exceptional item was assigned metadata using the "Tropy Correspondence" template (see https://docs.tropy.org/before-you-begin/metadata#tropy-correspondence). Two transcriptions rules were employed: 1. `purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title` is interpreted as document inscribed number and written as "Dokument nn" where 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, and 2. `purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator` and `purl.org/dc/terms/audience` were interpreted as sender and receiver respectively and transcribed diplomatically (i.e., exactly as seen is without normalization, with descending order of priority: letterhead and address; salutation and signature; letter body); inferred sender or receiver metadata is indicated with square brackets. The so generated metadata is available in `files/metadata/tropy_diplomatic_metadata.json`.
- Each image in `/files/images` was automatically segmented with CITlab Advanced and transcribed with PyLaia Transkribus print 0.3 using Transkribus (Expert Client v.1.17.0). The transcriptions were exported to the `/files/transcriptions` which contains transcriptions in four different formats: ALTO XML in `/files/transcriptions/alto`, PAGE XML in the folder `/files/transcriptions/page`, TEI XML in the folder `/files/transcriptions/tei`, and plain text in folder `/files/transcriptions/txt`. The folders `/files/transcriptions/alto`, `/files/transcriptions/page` and `/files/transcriptions/txt` contain a transcription for each image in `/files/images` (e.g., `0002.xml` in `files/transcriptions/alto` is the transcription of `0002.jpg` in `/files/images`; see the `/images/transkribus_metadata.xml` for the full details). In addition, `/files/transcriptions/page`, `/files/transcriptions/tei` and `/files/transcriptions/txt` contain the files `full_transcription.xml` and `full_transcription.txt` respectively with full transcriptions of all the images in `files/images`.

## Data analysis

The main task of data analysis was to automatically extract the persons mentioned in the collection using NER.

### NER using R and OpenRefine 

- The first step was to read each TXT-file into RStudio using R (v.4.1.1) to process the text and to have a basic identifier that can link any named entities back to the page they appeared on. This was done by listing all TXT-files and then reading them using the `readtext()` function (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readtext/readtext.pdf). The `doc-id` variable copies the file-name (e.g., `0001.txt`) and since this mirrors the image names (e.g., `0001.jpg`), the `doc-id` was used as a basis to create a variable `image` which links back to the relevant JPG-file. Next the spacyr (see https://github.com/quanteda/spacyr) `de_core_news_sm` model is used to parse all the texts and perform a named entity recognition. Every entity tagged as `PER`, named persons, will be used for further processing in OpenRefine. Since the linking variable unfortunately disappers when the text is parsed and a new document identifier is created (`text1`, `text2`, etc.), the original link (`0001.jpg`) was recreated using an `ifelse()`-chain. The resulting data frame was saved as `analysis/ner/persons.csv`, with the column `link` providing the name of the respective JPG-file. The script `files/spacy_update.R` documents all these processes.
- In OpenRefine, a text facet was added to `entity_type` to only include entities labelled `PER`. On the basis of the column named `entity`, a new column called `no.title` was created where titles were dropped (namely "Dr." and "Herrn"). Clustering was not an option for this new column, so it was further edited by hand: different spellings of the same name were normalized and entities that were labelled as `PER` but did not refer to a person were dropped. The resulting data frame (now only consisting of entities labelled `PER`) was then saved as `files/analysis/ner/persons_openrefine.csv`. All the changes made in OpenRefine are documented in `files/analysis/ner/persons_openrefine_changelog.json`.

### NER using Python and Protegé

- The `App.entities_per_document` method documented in `files/analysis/ner.py` was run to extract named entities per item using the spaCy (see https://spacy.io/)`de_core_news_lg` model and saved as `/files/analaysis/ner_python/ner_per_item.csv`.
- The extracted `PER` labels were manually controlled (i.e., non-persons labeled `PER` were deleted) and saved as `/files/analaysis/ner_python/ner_per_item_controlled.csv`.
- A minimal ontology for name normalization based on the "GND Ontology" (see https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd) was created using Protegé (v.5.5.0) and exported to `/files/analysis/schmeas/pnd.owl`. The names in `/files/analaysis/ner_python/ner_per_item_controlled.csv` were then manually normalized and the result saved as `/files/analaysis/ner_python/ner_per_item_normalized.csv`. Note that `dc:source`, `spacy:ent.start_char`, and `spacy:ent.end_char` jointly constitute `pnd:source`, and that `spacy:ent.text` is equivalent to `pnd:hasText` in this context.
- Finally, the names normalized in `/files/analaysis/ner_python/ner_per_item_normalized.csv` were manually aggregated into persons and saved as `/files/analaysis/ner_python/ner_individualized.json`.
